Known Limitations/Trade-offs
The drag sensitivity could be further optimized for better UX.
Cards do not retain their state after a page refresh.

Future Improvements
Add a backend API to load card data dynamically.
Implement mobile responsiveness for better UX on smaller screens.
Enhance the drag-and-drop animations with a physics-based library like GSAP.
